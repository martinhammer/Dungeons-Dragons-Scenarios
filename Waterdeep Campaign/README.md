Waterdeep Campaign
==================

This is a campaign for _D&D Adventure System Cooperative Play_ board games, specifically [Legend of Drizzt](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/board-card-games/legend-drizzt-board-game). The game itself comes with several scenarios, and there some additional great additional scenarios created by the community on [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91872/dungeons-dragons-legend-drizzt-board-game). In the original game the scenarios are not really connected into a "campaign", meaning each scenario stands on its own and the characters do not keep their treasures and experience points between them. Also, it is only possible to progress characters to Level 2 within each scenario, but at the start of next one your back at Level 1 again.

The idea of this project is to created a campaign where scenarios are linked together and follow an overall storyline. The characters develop throughout the campaign and can level up to Level 5. There is an opportunity to trade, i.e. buy and sell treasure between the scenarios.

Generally, the scenarios are intended to play with two characters. If you play a solo campaign, you may wish to select an ally.

The campaign gameplay is adapted from the following community content:
* [Legend of Drizzt: Hero Levelling cards for campaign play](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/72838/legend-drizzt-hero-levelling-cards-campaign-play) by ninjadorg
* [Legend of Drizzt Campaign Rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/136256/legend-drizzt-campaign-rules-no-other-dd-games-nee) by Mithrandir82

The scenarios within this campaign take their names and general ideas from quests in the [Lords of Waterdeep](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/board-games/lords-waterdeep) board game. However, this game or any knowledge of it is not at all required to play the campaign.
